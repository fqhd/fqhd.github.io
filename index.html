				Hello! My name is Fahd, I'm a computer science student with a particular interest in machine learning and 3D graphics. I have always been a huge fan of art and creativity which is why most of my projects will involve at least some level of image manipulation. For the past year I have been reading about image generation using machine learning, or ML for short. With that knowledge, I invented my own ML based image generation algorithm. It is not listed under the projects tab but you can find a link to the project here. I must say, however, that my favorite image generation technique is Google's deep dream. Implementing this algorithm has taught me so much about ML and computer vision, I cannot recommend it enough as an exercise if you're wanting to learn AI. I also love learning about math, specifically differential calculus. If you like my work, feel free to reach out to me via email or discord(Links at the bottom of the page). Finally, thank you for checking out my website!
