      <h2>AI & Graphics Developer - VideowindoW</h2>
      <h3><em>8-month paid internship</em></h3>
      <p>
        Developed and maintained the company's glare-control rendering application while conducting AI research into
        brightness interpolation and perceptual consistency. Implemented novel image interpolation techniques inspired
        by state-of-the-art papers in generative modeling. Worked extensively with <strong>Rust</strong> and
        <strong>Python</strong>, and trained models on Linux-based HPC infrastructure.

      <h2>Freelance Graphics Developer - Fiverr</h2>
      <h3><em>6-month part-time</em></h3>
      <p>
        Created custom <strong>3D rendering, raytracing, and visualization applications</strong> for clients using
        <strong>C++, OpenGL,</strong> and <strong>GLFW</strong>. Delivered optimized and visually rich projects, often
        involving real-time graphics and interactive design.

    <div class="experience-card">
      <h2>Research Collaboration - LoLSketch.com</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborated with the owner of the popular League of Legends Pictionary website to integrate an
        <strong>AI-based character classifier</strong> trained on user-submitted sketches. Designed and deployed the
        data collection pipeline, preprocessing scripts, and trained models, which were permanently integrated into the
        production site as a new game mode.

    <div class="experience-card">
      <h2>Published Research - arXiv.org</h2>
      <h3><em>“Comparative Analysis of Different Methods for Classifying Polychromatic Sketches”</em></h3>
      <p>
        Authored and published a research paper analyzing doodle classification methods using RGB-domain sketch data.
        Compared CNN and transformer-based models, visualized feature embeddings using <strong>t-SNE</strong>, and
        demonstrated fine-tuned <strong>ResNet-50</strong> marginally outperformed human accuracy.
