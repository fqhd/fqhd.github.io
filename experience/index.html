			<h1>VideowindoW</h1>
			<p>
				I worked full time at VideowindoW as a software developer for 8 months researching machine learning methods to produce
				good looking animations for glare control. My main responsibility was to innovate methods that can create procedurally animated videos that are both aesthetically pleasing and parametrized
				to smoothly change in brightness as a function of their environment. This enables us to modify the transparency of the glass
				to reduce the amount of glare and control the temperature and brightness of the room in real time. My responsibility involved reading, summarizing, and customizing state of
				the art solutions in generative machine learning research, includding diffusion models, generative adversarial networks, and autoencoders.
				Some methods were almost entirely AI
				powered, rendering full scenes using image generation models while others used neural networks to guide procedural generation of
				landscapes such as terrain and textures. My contributions were recognized by the team, and I received a formal letter of recommendation from my manager, available upon request.
