    <p class="paragraph">When I initially started this project, I just wanted to graph the win probability at the start of any game. After deveoping this idea further, I realized that win probability estimation at any given timestep is far more valuable. I then had the vision of creating a web application that allows users to review their games in a very fast and efficient manner. They should be able to look up their match history, and after selecting a game, be presented with a collection of visuals to help them identify their mistakes and any events that caused them the win the most.</main></p>
